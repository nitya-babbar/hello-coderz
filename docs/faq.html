					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				</div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="main-wrapper accordion-wrapper">
				<button class="accordion blue">How long is each Hello Coderz class and how do we pick a time?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					Hello Coderz has three different programs. No matter which program is selected, each class is an hour long. Once a student is registered, parents will receive an email with
					open time slots, and will be able to select a time slot that works for them and their child.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion orange">How does Hello Coderz ensure that students are learning and progressing?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					Students will be assigned 30 minutes to an hour of homework to complete by their next class. At the beginning of each class, 
					instructors will spend about 10-15 minutes reviewing the homework and any topics that the student may
					be struggling with. In addition, since a crucial part of learning to program includes lots of repetition and practice, some classes may be dedicated to solving problems using what the student already knows to ensure that they have a strong understanding.
					Since Hello Coderz is designed to be unique for each student, some students may move very fast if they are
					showing an understanding of the concepts faster, and others may move slower. Instructors decide on a 
					pace that works for the student.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					In addition, at the end of each level, students
					will be given a final project that utilizes knowledge from their current level and prior levels. They may also be given a test at instructor's discretion.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion blue">How do each of the programs at Hello Coderz work?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					Hello Coderz offers three programs: an individual program, two student program, and three student program.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					The individual program means that one student meets with one instructor for each class. This program 
					allows for the most individualization since the student can move at the pace most appropriate for them.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					The two student program means that two students meet with one instructor for each class, while the three 
					student program means that three students meet with one instructor for each class. It is recommended 
					that when enrolling for either of these two programs that all (two or three) students are found and intend
					to enroll together. For example, two / three siblings or two / three friends that are close in age would be ideal to sign up for these programs. This would be the most practical so that the students can start right away and work with other students who are close in age and ability.
					If you are interested in these programs, but do not know someone else to register with, please indicate that in
					the registration form. Your child may need to wait for another student to sign up for the same plan who is 
					also around the same age.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button class="accordion orange">Who are the Hello Coderz instructors?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					Hello Coderz hand selects instructors who have prior experience in teaching and are well above their peers academically.
					They have several years of computer science background, as well as many mathematics and computer science awards. Instructors 
					include high school juniors and seniors who are at the top of their class and college undergraduates from top universities majoring in computer science.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button class="accordion blue">What is the minimum and maximum grade for a student to join Hello Coderz?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					Hello Coderz is catered to students from 3rd grade to 10th grade.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button class="accordion orange">Can a student enroll in Hello Coderz in the middle of the year?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					A student can enroll in Hello Coderz at any time of the year and an open time slot will be found for them.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button class="accordion blue">What can we do if we cannot afford the Hello Coderz prices?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					If the Hello Coderz prices cannot be afforded, please select “yes” for financial aid when filling out the 
					registration form, and we will work with you to ensure that your child can enroll.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<button class="accordion orange">How can I apply for a job at Hello Coderz?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
					You can apply for a job by filling out the job form. You must be either a junior or senior in high school or an 
					engineering undergraduate in college. You must also have a thorough understanding of Python. Compensation will be decided based on experience.
